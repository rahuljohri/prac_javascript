Javascript was created as livescript intially but becuase java was so popular, so it was named that.
It follows ECMA standard.
Java script can execute on any browser and on a server also.
Different browsers have different javascript engine or javascript virtual machine.
We have different javascript engine like v8 in chrome and opera, others in different browsers.
A javascript engine basically parses the script and converts the script into machine language and then machine language is fast.
